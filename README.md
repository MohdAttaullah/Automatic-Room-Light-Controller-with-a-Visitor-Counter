# Automatic-Room-Light-Controller-with-a-Visitor-Counter

## Automatic Room Light Control
When we enter a room, as a habitual tendency, we often search for a switch to turn the light on, and if we are new to the room, we often find it difficult to locate the switch. Most of the times, many of us forget to switch off the lights while leaving the room in which we stay most of the time. This results in unnecessary power wastage. Therefore, an automatic room-light controller automatically turns on the lights when a person enters into a room, and turns off the lights when the person leaves the room. This automatic room controller can be implemented by using a simple microcontroller(here we are using arduino uno) and wireless IR technologies.

### Automatic Room Light Controller with a Visitor Counter
This system is designed by using two sets of IR transmitters and receivers. These IR sensors are placed in such a way that they detect a person entering and leaving the room to turn the home appliances. In this optimun energy management system, a microcontroller is the central processing unit of this project which is arduino uno. This system facilitates a bidirectional visitor counter for displaying the number of persons inside the room.
